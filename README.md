# World Cup FC2

Fantasy World Cup Streamlit app for eight fixed coaches:

Benji, Jeff, Peter, Chad, Lamp, Herb, Jayme, Spencer.

Each coach drafts 8 national teams and 2 star players. The draft order is fixed in code and cannot be edited in Admin.

## Run

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Share Link

Use this GitHub Pages URL for iMessage previews:

```text
https://theleitas.github.io/world-cup-fc2/
```

That page uses `docs/titlethumb.png` for the preview image and then redirects visitors to the Streamlit app:

```text
https://world-cup-fc2.streamlit.app/
```

## Persistence

The app stores shared state in `draft_state.json`.

On Streamlit Cloud, add these secrets:

```toml
[GITHUB]
TOKEN = "PASTE_MY_GITHUB_TOKEN_HERE"
OWNER = "theleitas"
REPO_NAME = "world-cup-fc2"

[FOOTBALL_DATA]
TOKEN = "PASTE_MY_FOOTBALL_DATA_TOKEN_HERE"

[API_FOOTBALL]
TOKEN = "PASTE_MY_API_FOOTBALL_TOKEN_HERE"
```

If no GitHub token is present, the app reads and writes local `draft_state.json`. Football-Data powers the main league scoring. API-Football is used only for the separate Goalie Challenge goalkeeper saves scoring.

## Admin

Admin is intentionally open for this private league app.

Admin can edit coach colors, the 25-player pool, odds, advancement bonuses, enable/disable the public draft room, and reset rosters. Manual match and player stat editors are hidden inside `Emergency Manual Overrides` and should only be used if Football-Data is wrong, delayed, or unavailable.

Admin cannot edit draft order.

Roster reset is protected by a confirmation checkbox and by typing `RESET`.

## Data Seeds

- Qualified teams are seeded from FIFA's official 48-team qualified list.
- Futures odds are seeded from current pre-tournament winner markets and remain editable in Admin.
- Match and drafted-player data refresh from Football-Data.org when a token is configured; otherwise emergency manual override tables are available in Admin.

## Live Data

When `FOOTBALL_DATA.TOKEN` is configured, the app refreshes automatically about every five minutes and also exposes a manual `Refresh Scores` button.

It uses:

- `GET /v4/competitions/WC/matches?season=2026` with `X-Unfold-Goals: true` for fixtures, live scores, final scores, goal scorers, assists, group-stage player stats, and knockout-stage advancement.
- `GET /v4/competitions/WC/scorers?season=2026&limit=100` as an aggregate backup for player goals and assists.

Football-Data's official v4 docs show assist data both on goal events and on the competition scorers endpoint. If an assist is returned as `null` for a goal, the app leaves it uncounted.

## Cinderella Scoring

The Cinderella Award is automatic and uses a locked pre-tournament FIFA ranking baseline. The award goes to the coach who owns the single drafted team with the biggest overperformance, not to the coach with the largest combined Cinderella portfolio.

Baseline source: FIFA/Coca-Cola Men's World Ranking, locked to the April 1, 2026 update for the 48 qualified World Cup teams.

Formula:

```text
team cinderella = actual team fantasy points - FIFA expected points
Cinderella winner = highest team cinderella among all drafted teams
```

FIFA expected points are scaled from FIFA ranking points among the 48-team World Cup field:

```text
strength = (team FIFA points - lowest qualified FIFA points) / (highest qualified FIFA points - lowest qualified FIFA points)
FIFA expected points = 6 + strength * 48
```

That makes the top-ranked qualified team worth about 54 expected points and the lowest-ranked qualified team worth about 6 expected points before the tournament begins.

The app also renders a `Cinderella Standings` table showing the top 10 drafted teams by this delta.
